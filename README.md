# The Game of Battleships (one-sided version)
This is my implementation for the challenge that I have recently been given.

Branches:
- **master** contains the latest version of a console application with the game.
- **feature/board-view** (already merged into master) contains an addition in which the human player, after typing "show the board", is shown the complete board with ships that have been placed by the computer.
- **feature/simplified** (already merged into master) contains applied changes based on review feedback

Steps to build and run it:
1. git clone https://github.com/emwiechnik/battleships.git
2. open Battleships.sln in Visual Studio with .NET Core 3.1
3. build and run project *Battleships*.
